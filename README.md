# React TDD Calculator
[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.com/ttarnowski/react-tdd-calculator.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.com/ttarnowski/react-tdd-calculator)

A simple calculator created using pure React.js and refactored to use MobX.

The development process has been loosely based on the [Test-Driven Development with React, Jest, and Enzyme](https://testdriven.io/blog/tdd-with-react-jest-and-enzyme-part-one/) tutorial.

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).
